There have also been reports that the virus has spread through blood transfusions.

One in five people do get symptoms, which can include a fever, rash, joint pain, and conjunctivitis (<a href='https://medlineplus.gov/pinkeye.html'>pinkeye</a>). Symptoms are usually mild, and start 2 to 7 days after being bitten by an infected mosquito.</p> <p>A blood test can tell whether you have the infection. There are no vaccines or medicines to treat it. Drinking lots of fluids, resting, and taking acetaminophen might help.</p> <p>Zika can cause microcephaly (a serious <a href='https://medlineplus.gov/brainmalformations.html'>birth defect of the brain</a>) and other problems in babies whose mothers were infected while pregnant. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that pregnant women do not travel to areas where there is a Zika virus outbreak. If you do decide to travel, first talk to your doctor. You should also be careful to prevent <a href='https://medlineplus.gov/mosquitobites.html'>mosquito bites</a>:</p> <ul> <li>Use insect repellent</li> <li>Wear clothes that cover your arms, legs, and feet</li> <li>Stay in places that have air conditioning or that use window and door screens</li> </ul> <p >Centers for Disease Control and Prevention</p>"

Upon oral administration, brincidofovir crosses the intestinal wall and penetrates target viral-infected cells before being cleaved to the free antiviral agent cidofovir. In turn, cidofovir is phosphorylated by pyruvate kinases to its active metabolite cidofovir diphosphate. Cidofovir diphosphate, bearing structural similarity to nucleotides, competes with deoxycytosine-5-triphosphate (dCTP) for viral DNA polymerase and gets incorporated into the growing viral DNA strands. As a result, it prevents further DNA polymerization and disrupts DNA replication of viruses.

Based on currently available information, SARS-CoV-2 is thought to mainly spread from person to person through respiratory droplets. Typically, there is a two- to 14-day incubation period and infected persons can present with no symptoms or mild to severe fever, dry cough, fatigue, and difficulty breathing. Dysgeusia, anosmia, and gastrointestinal and flu-like symptoms have also been reported. Older adults and persons of any age who have serious underlying medical conditions may be of higher risk for severe illness, including secondary infections, respiratory failure, and multi-organ dysfunction."

All of these conditions are grouped under the name of factors inherent in the patient. \n\nIn addition, the patient's level of motivation and confidence tends to lead to greater personal effectiveness in controlling behavior in the face of illness, so these are issues that are also grouped here.\n\nOther characteristics involved in adherence to medication are the patient's personality, poor sleep quality [2] and cognitive impairment [3].\n\n[1] De Geest, S., & Sabaté, E.

        "A pentacyclic lupane-type triterpene derivative of betulin (isolated from the bark of Betula alba, the common white birch) with antiinflammatory, anti-HIV and antineoplastic activities. Betulinic acid induces apoptosisthrough induction of changes in mitochondrial membrane potential, production of reactive oxygenspecies, and opening of mitochondrial permeability transition pores, resulting in the release of mitochondrialapogenic factors, activation of caspases, and DNA fragmentation. Although originally thought to exhibit specific cytotoxicity against melanoma cells, this agent has been found to be cytotoxic against non-melanoma tumor cell types including neuroectodermal.and brain tumor cells.
